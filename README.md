# JavascriptSampleCode
Javascript using Google Maps Api
In this project I have written a javscript code for two scenarios
(i) Finding the location of user and displaying on google maps with the latitude and longitude coordinates when allow to track the location. 
(ii)The second scenario is where when I input the address and it would show the latitude and longitude coordinates
I have written a javscript code for execution.

This javascript is compatible with firefox 35 and above and google chrome 5. 
I have executed it in firefox.
